# Gateway SDK

The TypeScript Gateway SDK provides a simple way of querying "state" on the Radix Network.

Web3 applications often need information about the current (or past) state of things on the Radix Network. Things such as:

- What resources are currently held in a given account?

- What is the configuration and metadata of a given resource?

- What happened in a given transaction?

- What is the status of a given component?

The Gateway SDK is a thin wrapper around the [Gateway API](index.md), documentation for this API can be found <a href="https://radix-babylon-gateway-api.redoc.ly/" target="_blank">here</a>.

:::note
Note if you are already using the Radix dApp Toolkit, it exposes an interface for this and you do not need to import seperately.
