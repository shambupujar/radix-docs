### Radix Foundation

The foundation does *not* provide a public Core API.

### Grove

[Grove](https://www.grove.city/) — the founder of [POKT network](http://www.pokt.network/) — [has integrated Radix](https://www.radixdlt.com/blog/radix-partners-with-grove-to-power-devex-in-defi) to provide API services to community developers. Community developers can use the Core API via Grove for free, up to a total of 5m request per day.

Grove is providing the following two options to get started: \* Immediate access to a Core API can be obtained for free using the following Grove-powered public endpoint as a base URL: `https://radix-mainnet.rpc.grove.city/v1/326002fc/core` \* For those interested in more granular control over their endpoints, including allowlisting capabilities, logging, and usage insights, a free private Radix endpoint can be minted at <https://portal.grove.city>.

### NowNodes

[NowNodes](https://nownodes.io/nodes) has added support for the Radix Core API (at `xrd.nownodes.io`).

Their [pricing plans are available here](https://nownodes.io/pricing) and include the option of a month-long free trial.

### Run your own

[Running a node](/v1/docs/run-infrastructure) is relatively straightforward, and gives you control of your infrastructure, although will require keeping the node updated regularly along with the network’s protocol updates.
