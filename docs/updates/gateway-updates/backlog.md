# Backlog

## Higher Priority

-  Implicit Requirements (e.g. Global caller) index - to look up a global caller / public key etc from its hash

## General Items

- Improved tracing through the Gateway service to improve debugging

*The backlog will be expanded once Gateway discovery completes.*

## Acknowledged

- Aggregator failover - we recommend running parallel Gateways if this is a concern.
- Exposing blueprint / method details - this is currently handled better by the Engine State API.
