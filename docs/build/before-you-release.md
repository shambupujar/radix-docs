# Before You Release

The goal of this set of articles is to introduce developers to some of the common bugs, misconfigurations, and oversights they may encounter during the development process and provide examples of exploits that may arise from this as well as mitigation techniques. As the title of the article suggests, developers should go through this article before releasing their applications, but this is also a good article to read before starting to build an application as it highlights several areas that may require special consideration during the development process. This article includes topics related to blueprint security, blueprint behavior, low-hanging fruits for fee optimizations, and user experience in the wallet.

The following are the articles available under this section:

- [Code Hardening](scrypto/code-hardening.md)
- [Productionize Your Code](scrypto/productionize-your-code.md)
