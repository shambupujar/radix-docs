# Learning Step-by-Step

We've made two learning paths to teach you how to build on Radix, one for if you want to <a href="#scrypto-and-front-end"><strong>make full stack apps</strong></a> (using Scrypto for on ledger components and JS for the front end) and another for if you want to <a href="#front-end"><strong>build and connect a front end web app to existing scrypto components</strong></a>.

## Scrypto

If you’re **only planning to build on ledger** (in Scrypto) then follow <a href="#scrypto-and-front-end">the full stack path</a>. Sections covering front end interactions are marked as skippable.

## Scrypto and Front End

This step-by-step guide will build you up from the very basics of Scrypto all the way through to a full application with a frontend. It is intended to be followed from start to end, but if you’re just looking to achieve specific tasks you can browse the steps by topic below.
