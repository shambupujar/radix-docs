# dApp Toolkit

The <a href="https://github.com/radixdlt/radix-dapp-toolkit/tree/main" target="_blank">Radix dApp Toolkit</a> wraps together the <a href="https://github.com/radixdlt/wallet-sdk" target="_blank">Wallet SDK</a> and [Gateway SDK](../../integrate/network-apis/gateway-sdk.md) along with a framework agnostic √ <a href="https://github.com/radixdlt/connect-button" target="_blank">Connect Button</a> web component. Together they make it easy for developers to connect users and their Radix Wallet to their dApps.

## √ Connect Button







The √ Connect Button appears as a consistent, Radix-branded UI element that helps users identify your dApp website as a Radix dApp and compatible with the Radix Wallet – and it automatically provides a consistent user experience for users to connect with their wallet and see the current status of the connection between dApp and Radix Wallet.
