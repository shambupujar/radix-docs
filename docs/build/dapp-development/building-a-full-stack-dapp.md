# Building a Full Stack dApp

## Overview

A Full Stack dApp adds a traditional server backend component to do things that a [pure frontend dApp](building-a-frontend-dapp.md) can’t.

For an overview of dApp types on Radix, see [What is a dApp on Radix](application-stack.md)?

Here’s the big picture of a full stack dApp. You’ll see the portion on the left is identical to the pure frontend dApp, but now a server backend portion has been added to the right, including new tools for you to use. The **green blocks** below are built by you, while the **blue blocks** are existing tools for you to make use of.
