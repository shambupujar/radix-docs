# Setting up for Development

You can develop applications for Radix, both frontend and backend, on Mac, Linux, or Windows, using free tools.

Please be aware that most of the example content is written for Mac/Linux environments, and Windows users will need to translate some concepts over to their environment, particularly shell script examples.

If you haven’t yet read through the [Essentials](../essentials/overview.md) section, it’s a good idea to run through that before returning here to get set up, and it should take you less than 5 minutes to complete.

You can also sign up for the [Developer Program](https://developers.radixdlt.com/devprogram) to receive communications about the latest development news, earn rewards, and gain priority access to dev events.

For frontend and fullstack development take a look at the [Developer Quick Start Guides](/docs/developer-quick-start) and for Radix Engine development in Scrypto you’ll be able to get started by [setting up Scrypto here](developer-quick-start.md).
