# Costing & Limits

Pages in this section describe how the Radix Engine applies costing and limits during the execution of a transaction.

**Costing** is the process of billing for the computation and storage that a transaction consumes. This is to encourage fair use of the network capacity while disincentivizing transaction spamming. As of now, XRD is the only currency used for costing.

**Limits** are designed to prevent an individual transaction from placing too high a burden on any specific part of the stack, ensuring that every node meeting a minimum configuration specification is able to successfully process the transaction in a timely fashion.
