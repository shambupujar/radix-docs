#### **Reusable Code**

Radix redefines smart contracts by dividing them into modular blueprints and components, enabling reusable structures with distinct state management and logic while incentivizing developers through a built-in royalty system. [More here](reusable-code.md)

#### **Transactions on Radix**

Radix enhances transaction functionality by utilizing atomic transaction manifests that orchestrate multiple on-ledger component calls, ensuring all-or-nothing execution and empowering users with customizable guarantees. [More here](transactions-on-radix.md)

#### **Authorization Approach**
