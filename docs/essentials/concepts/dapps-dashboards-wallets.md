# DApps, Dashboards & Wallets

Not so relevant to exchange integrations - but for completeness, it’s useful to briefly explain how users will interact with the Radix ecosystem.

- Users will use a mobile wallet. The mobile wallet is designed to feel intuitive for both a mainstream user and a power user, and includes features such as smart accounts (multi-factor + recovery), as well as clear understanding of what’s in a transaction, and transaction preview - made possible by the power of the transaction manifest and design of the Radix network.
- Users will connect to dApps by running an extension in their browser, and use the Radix connect button in a DApp in order to connect with their wallet.

A demonstration of wallet features is set out in the [RadFi keynote](https://www.radixdlt.com/radfi).
