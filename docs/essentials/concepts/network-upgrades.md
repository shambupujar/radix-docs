# Network Upgrades

There will be occasional network upgrades, called “Protocol Updates” (sometimes called “forks” on other chains) which will require upgrading your Babylon node software.

If you stick to using the LTS supported endpoints for your integrations, these upgrades will not be expected to result in significant changes to your integration - these will not be large upgrades like the Olympia to Babylon migration.

The move to a sharded ledger at Xi’an may require minor changes to your integration, but this is some distance in the future.
