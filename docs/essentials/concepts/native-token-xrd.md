# Native Token XRD

The “Radix” token is called “XRD” and is the native token of the Radix ledger. It behaves like any other resource on the network.

It is a fungible resource and there are 1018 “attos” in 1 XRD. In other words, it has the default/maximum divisibility for a fungible resource of 18: one subunit is 10-18 units.

XRD is used to pay transaction fees, and for staking to validators for delegated-proof-of-stake security for consensus.
